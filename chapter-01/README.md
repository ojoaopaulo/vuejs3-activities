The purpose of the activity 1.01 is to build an interactive application that allows the user to create and delete individual items, and to clear the entire list with a single click.

## Knowledge from the chapter

In this chapter, I came into contact with the basic resources of a Single File Component (SFC), such as expressions, loops, two-way bindings, and event handling.
