# üìó Chapter-01

The purpose of the activity 1.01 is to build an interactive application that allows the user to create and delete individual items, and to clear the entire list with a single click.

## üß† Knowledge from the chapter

- In this chapter, I came into contact with the basic resources of a Single File Component (SFC), such as expressions, loops, two-way bindings, and event handling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes and Challenges

- As I already had some experience with Vue.js 3, I didn't really face any problems with this activity. The only challenge was having to recall some JavaScript concepts like `array.prototype.splice()`, since I hadn't worked with JavaScript for a couple months.

- I also notice that this chapter didn't mention `ref` or `reactive`. If you check the official solution, you will see that it uses the Options API. Since I'm already familiar with Vue's reactive systems, I decided to use `ref`.

- Finally, when reviewing the official solution after completing mine, I notice that they included unit tests. Altough testing hasn't been introduced yet in the book, I'd like to write my own tests too, but using the official solution as a reference.</br></br>
