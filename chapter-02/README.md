# üìó Chapter-02

The activity 2.01 involves creating a blog that lists articles using an external API as the data source. The activity mentions `Contentful`, a headless content management system (CMS). It also requires the use of **computed properties** to display nested data from the API response - which will need the use of `async` methods -, as well as data manipulation to exhibit the user's name, role title, and description.

## üß† Knowledge from the chapter

- This chapter introduces **computed properties** and their *getters* and *setters*; 
- It explores **watchers**, including **deep watchers** for nested data;
- It also covers **async methods** and **data search**;
- And it presents a comparison between **methods**, **watchers**, and **computed properties**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes and Challenges

- To be honest, I learned more and put more effort creating the unit tests than I did in the lesson itself.

- The lesson only required *computed properties* for a very simple use case.

- And one thing that bothered me was that, in this activity, you had to access to official solution to get the *Contentful* setup. I don't think that's a good approach, since it exposes the solution before you've had the chance to try it on your own.
