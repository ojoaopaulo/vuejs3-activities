# ðŸ“— Chapter-03

The Activity 3.01 tests our knowledge of creating a `Vue.js` project using `Vite`. During the project setup, we are required to install `Vue Router` and `Pinia`.

The component we will create must include two inputs (first name and last name) and display the full name based on these inputs. Lastly, we need to analyze the component's rendering performance using the `Performance` tab in `Vue Devtools`.

## ðŸ§  Knowledge from the chapter

- This chapter introduced `Vite`, a build tool that simplifies the proccess of creating a new Vue.js project. It allows developers to easily add `Vue Router`, `Pinia`, `ESlint`, `Prettier`, and more during setup.

- It also introduced `Vue Devtools`, a browser extension that helps debug Vue.js applications directly in the browser.
